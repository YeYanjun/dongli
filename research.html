	<h1>Lagrangian advection schemes</h1>
	<p>
        This is a continuing work of my PhD research, toward a new practical
        advection scheme constructed in Lagrangian framework which can be
        applied in the atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). The
        advection equation is as following
        \[
            \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla{\rho} =
            -\rho\nabla\cdot\mathbf{V}
        \]
        The major starting point is to reduce the numerical diffusion error
        revealed in the Eulerian schemes (including semi-Lagrangian schemes).
	</p>
    <p>
        Previously, I have constructed two Lagrangian schemes with different
        discretization fashions, namely TTS-C (Dong and Wang, 2012) and TTS-I
        (Dong and Wang, 2013). Both of them exhibit lower numerical diffusion
        as expected.

        In TTS-C, the continuous tracer is discretized into parcel centroids
        with finite number, which carry tracer density and move around under
        the influence of the flow. The density is time varying according to the
        flow divergence, and it is remapped onto the grids of the model (e.g.
        AGCM) by using the inverse-distance weight (IDW) interpolation. This is
        the first Lagrangian scheme that I have ever made, so it is simple in
        concept and shows the good merit of Lagrangian schemes (much lower
        numerical diffusion). But there are some weak points:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The total mass on the grids is not guaranteed to conserved on
                the model grids, and it is not possible to define the mass
                carried by a parcel, since the parcels have no shape and then
                no definite volume. (<i>Actually, the volume can be defined as
                in HEL scheme (Kaas et al. 2013).</i>)
            </li>
            <li>
                There exists <i>aliasing error</i> or <i>spectral blocking</i>,
                because the parcels have no shape and the remapping procedures
                involve only distance information, but in deformative flow the
                parcel shape will no longer keep compact and turn to be long
                filament espectially in high shear region. (ATTILA (Reithmeier
                and Sausen 2002) and HEL use mixing among parcels to reduce
                this error for long time simulation)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        To address the above weak points, I wondered how to describe the shape
        of the parcel. At first, I found out
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a>
        that is good at partition space according to given data set. It looks
        like the cure for my problem and I can let parcel carry mass, but it
        turned out that the construction of this diagram can not take into
        account of the flow deformation. Although this path has been blocked, I
        had an idea that I should use polygon to describe the interface (or
        shape) of the parcels. So it came out TTS-I with the parcel interface
        discretized as a polygon in 2D. The details can be found in Dong and
        Wang (2013) where a complicate curvature guard algorithm has been
        devised. This algorithm dynamically inserts or removes edges from the
        polygon to capture the curvature changes in the deformational flow. In
        the deformation test flow proposed by Nair and Lauritzen (2010), TTS-I
        showed good performance of preserving discontinuity, filament and
        tracer correlation. The aliasing error mentioned in Kaas et al. (2013)
        did not appear! So we can deduce from this observation that <b>the
        aliasing error is caused by not simulating the shape of parcels</b>.
        As TTS-C, TTS-I has the vital shortcoming: The polygon is only valid
        in 2D. When applied to 3D, either the polyhedra or a quasi-2D vertical
        coordinate should be used. The former will deadly increase the
        complexity of the scheme and is not practical. The latter will
        introduce vertical remapping which is not very preferred.

        After being in a dilemma for a while, I found the Finite Mass Method
        (FMM), which uses the <b>linear transformation matrix</b> to describe
        the shape of parcels. In other words, the parcel can translate, rotate
        and change size.

        Figure 2 is the latest results of LASM, which exhibits the effects of
        the interparcel mixing. The experiment setup follows
        the deformation test case (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999110004511">Nair and Lauritzen 2010</a>; <a
        href="http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/5/189/2012/gmdd-5-189-2012.html">Lauritzen et al.
        2012</a>) with non-divergent flow. The initial condition is two
        slotted cylinders that are discontinuous. The left column contains
        interparcel mixing, whereas the right column does not. So it can be
        seen that the mixing operation introduces some interparcel
        mixing, but the degree is highly acceptable.

                \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\). With smaller \(\gamma_m\), the

                controls the degree of lateral mixing, and larger value means
                less lateral mixing.

        Figure 3 is the comparison with TSPAS (Two-step Shape Preserving
        Scheme, <a
        href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02658169">Yu
        1994</a>), which belongs the finite difference method. In the ideal
        deformation case, TSPAS shows unbelievably large errors (e.g numerical
        diffusion error, shape error), but in the two barotropic cases, TSPAS
        is more close to LASM, because the flow deformation is not that large
        as in the deformation case.

        The interparcel mixing in LASM is <b>adaptive</b> to the flow so that the
        mixing is triggered only where the linear deformation approximation of
        the parcel shape will be violated.
