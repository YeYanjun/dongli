	<h1>Lagrangian advection schemes</h1>
	<p>
        This is a continuing work of my PhD research, toward a new practical
        advection scheme constructed in Lagrangian framework which can be
        applied in the atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). The major
        starting point is to reduce the numerical diffusion error revealed in
        Eulerian schemes (including semi-Lagrangian schemes).
	</p>
	<p>
        Previously, I have constructed two Lagrangian schemes with different
        discretization fashions, namely TTS-C (Dong and Wang, 2012) and TTS-I
        (Dong and Wang, 2013). Both of them exhibit lower numerical diffusion
        as expected. In TTS-C, the continuous tracer is discretized into parcel
        centroids with finite number.

        In TTS-C, the continuous tracer is discretized into parcel centroids
        with finite number, which carry tracer density and move around under
        the influence of the flow. The density is time varying according to the
        flow divergence, and it is remapped onto the grids of the model (e.g.
        AGCM) by using the inverse-distance weight (IDW) interpolation. This is
        the first Lagrangian scheme that I have ever made, so it is simple in
        concept and shows the good merit of Lagrangian schemes (much lower
        numerical diffusion). But there are some weak points:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The total mass on the grids is not guaranteed to conserved on
                the model grids, and it is not possible to define the mass
                carried by a parcel, since the parcels have no shape and then
                no definite volume. (<i>Actually, the volume can be defined as
                in HEL scheme (Kaas et al. 2013).</i>)
            </li>
            <li>
                There exists <i>aliasing error</i> or <i>spectral blocking</i>,
                because the parcels have no shape and the remapping procedures
                involve only distance information, but in deformative flow the
                parcel shape will no longer keep compact and turn to be long
                filament espectially in high shear region. (ATTILA (Reithmeier
                and Sausen 2002) and HEL use mixing among parcels to reduce
                this error for long time simulation)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        To address the above weak points, I wondered how to describe the shape
        of the parcel. At first, I found out
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a>
        that is good at partition space according to given data set. It looks
        like the cure for my problem and I can let parcel carry mass, but it
        turned out that the construction of this diagram can not take into
        account of the flow deformation. Although this path has been blocked, I
        had an idea that I should use polygon to describe the interface (or shape)
        of the parcels.
