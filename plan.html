    <h1>Model diagnostics platform</h1>
    <p>
        The performance of a climate model (e.g. atmospheric model or oceanic model or even coupled model) is evaluated by plenty of metrics. Every model will have its strength and weakness, so the synthetical metrics must be consulted when judging the model. The most simple and used metric is the climatology of many quantities, but the more interesting information come from the more complex metrics, such as MJO, which give the prospect of the coupled processes in the climate system.

        To ease the burden of model development, we plan to construct a platform for evaluating model simulation results with sufficient standardized diagnostics (organized as packages).
